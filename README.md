# Mobile Flashcards
This is a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.


## Getting Started
Please run the following command in the directory:
* `yarn install`
* `yarn start`
